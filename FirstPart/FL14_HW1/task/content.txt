Fructose, or
fruit sugar, is a simple
ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose.
It is one of the three dietary
monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into blood during digestion.
Its formula is C6H12O6 and its density is 1.694 g/cm3 .
Fructose was discovered by French chemist
Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in
1847, not in 1848.

It makes us strong!
This is emphasized.

Excessive consumption of fructose (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages) may contribute to insulin resistance, obesity, elevated
Low-density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, leading to metabolic syndrome.
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA stated that fructose may be preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages because of its lower effect on postprandial blood sugar levels, and noted that
high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and increased visceral adiposity (this is a citation).

Blockquotes
Letâ€™s keep it simple. Italics are good to help set it off from the body text. Be sure to style the citation.

"I think we're all sensitive, everyone has a certain way about themselves that people don't like to let their emotions out too often. I think people tend to suppress them and hold them in, so I think there's a bit of that in me."

Jason Statham
